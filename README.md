# Better Than Yesterday

Better Than Yesterday is a social network application thought
to help the realities of volunteering and civil commitment
organizing and sharing their activities and initiatives. 

The project is no-profit and completely open source. 

It is highly recommended, before viewing the code, to read the technical PDF where an overview of the project is provided.

Every file in the lib folder is commented to help the user in his understanding.

As for now, no license was registered and the repository is private. 
However, in the near future, before the actual publication on Play Store,
an MIT license will be registered and the repository made public, making the project 100% open source.

To download the application, follow the instructions in the Abstract (page 1) of the technical PDF.
